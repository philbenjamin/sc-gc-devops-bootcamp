## Overview

The fourth lab is a demo of how we can quickly deploy 75 servers to Google Cloud.

> Note: Executing this lab will result in **75** n1-standard-1 vm's being deployed in your environment. If you have not requested a vCPU quota increase this may not complete successfully.

## Configure GitHub App Triggers

We will now configure a Cloud Build trigger that will run the terraform commands to deploy the networking and compute resources in this project.

1. Open the **Triggers** page in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and click **Create Trigger**

2. Similar to Lab 1, enter a name (E.g., `lab4-trigger`) and description (E.g., `trigger for lab 4`) for your trigger.

3. Under Event, select Push to a new branch.

4. Under Source, select the repository that was connected earlier (E.g., githubuser/MyDevOpsBootCamp (GitHub App)). Enter `.*` for branch to trigger build on all branches.

5. Expand the 'Show Included and Ignored File Filters' section and enter `lab_4/**` under 'Included files filter (glob)' to indicate that only changes under the `lab_4/` folder should trigger a build. Enter `lab_4/destroy.txt` under 'Ignored files filter (glob)' to indicate that the file should not trigger a build.

6. Enter `lab_4/cloudbuild-lab4.yaml` under 'Cloud Build configuration file (YAML or JSON)'. This configuration file defines the build steps that will be performed when a build is triggered.

7. Click Create to finish creating the trigger on Cloud Build.

## Create Terraform Deployment

Trigger a terraform deployment to create 75 vm's via GitHub and Cloud Build

1. Navigate to **Code**, and browse to the `lab_4/readme.txt` file. Click the pencil icon to edit the file, and add a new line. Provide a commit message and commit your change.

## Clean Up Resources

To mimimize billing usage in your subscription we can remove all of the resources we deployed with Cloud Build by executing a Terraform destroy.

1. Create a new trigger on Cloud Build called `lab4-destroy-trigger`.

2. Use similar settings to the trigger created previously, except set the Included files filter to `lab_4/destroy.txt`, leave the Ignored files filter blank. For the Build Configuration, set the Cloud Build configuration file to `lab_4/cloudbuild-destroy-lab4.yaml`. Click create to finish creating the trigger.

3. Go to the triggers page and select Run trigger to manually execute the build, which will destroy all the resources created.

4. Once the build is completed we can open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and confirm the resources we created earlier are now deleted.
